► Welcome to My Practice Arena!
This repository is my personal daily log for solving Data Structures and Algorithms problems. The main goal is to stay consistent, build a strong foundation, and track my progress over time. Each day, I tackle new problems and push the solutions here.

Har din, main yahan naye problems solve karke push karta hoon.

► How This Repository is Organized
The structure is simple and organized by day and topic. Each folder contains the practice questions and solutions for that specific concept.

📁 Day2_Variables&DataTypes

📁 Day3_Operators

... and so on.
